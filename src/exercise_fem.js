This can then tell us vaguely how to affect mouspace.

- say iii in a lazy, mumbled way, not moving the mouth much just for comparison
- say iii like a "valley girl", or overdo the vowel to exaggerate it
- compare between the dark "uhh" and bright "iii" sound
- be careful not to do a wide smile during the iii
- note the change in brightness, and also the change in mouth posture and mouth space
- when speaking, try a dark "uhhh" like sound and then try doing a bright sound like you did with the iii
- "baby speak" can also bring out small mouth space

    title:`Pitch Naturalization Floating`, desc:
`Pitch naturalization using pitch "floating". This is a good introduction to pitch naturalisation, and the basic idea is "just do a slightly higher voice and let it adjust". It is very basic and intuitive, but extends even into advanced control especially with set pitch naturalisation.


- speak at your relaxed, not-doing-anything pitch
- make sure to start strong, possibly a little bit louder and heavier than normal
- make <b>the last word of each phrase held longer</b> and monotone as it rests on the <b>base pitch</b> which helps keep the base pitch consistent
- base pitch is the pitch your voice returns to after intonation, and it's what is raising the entire voice up to that "anchor"
- once you feel comfortable here, let that last word and note float up a tiny bit, raising the whole voice
- repeat, but don't push the pitch too high, the goal is to naturalize all of your range, not raise pitch
- be extremely patient; if you rush or try too hard to control things, it won't work
- lean toward less airflow but moderately loud
- going up in pitch should be extremely easy, suspiciously so; if not, spend more time letting it naturalise here or start again
- pitch naturalisation is called that because at each pitch, the voice sounds natural as if it's always been at this pitch and this is your "natural voice"

    title:`Loud Pitch Naturalisation`, desc:
`Good for reducing compensations like breathiness, tension etc if it happens during normal pitch naturalisation, and also helps with gaining loud volume without weight coming back in.


- do the normal pitch naturalisation exercises but loud
- "trying to speak over the noise at a party" level of volume is ideal, don't shout but don't let it go quiet
- don't sacrifice the volume as you raise pitch
- the loudness is there to stop you compensating
- when you go quiet it will be easier to add strain, breathiness etc to hide weight
- take it much slower and be more conservative with the pitch raises than usual; you'll need more time because it's louder
- loudness-weight conflation is common and this is why it will take longer to naturalise without going quiet, and also *why* it's important to keep it from going quiet
- don't push the pitch up to the top of your range, be careful not to overstep your boundaries
- occasional exploration of your range is ok though
- slow down as you get higher; F3 might take a minute or several to naturalise
- so spend more time on higher pitches
- if you notice a "pushing" to reach the higher intonation, don't raise base pitch
- you can blend with M2, and this is mostly good, but you should wait until you need to

`Useful for advanced control and isolating vocal weight, but also for getting a light vocal weight at a low pitch which is otherwise difficult.


- pick a pitch to use as a base pitch; make sure it's not too high, it should be easy to do in your heavier, more masculine voice
- slide up to this pitch and speak one phrase monotone, keeping it loud and strong
- start the second phrase a little higher, but have it come down to the base pitch again by the end, making it easier to add intonation
- at no point in this exercise should you 'try' to do anything, and it's best to avoid focusing on any individual aspects. Instead, is the overall voice getting more natural and easy to use?
- at each pitch step your goal is to become more lazy and relaxed over time and to get used to speaking at this level; your body wants to do certain things to the voice at each pitch and so you should let it.
- when you're very very comfortable and it feels natural and not 'pushed' to speak here, go to the next pitch or start again
- if you can let the intonation naturally go quite high, then you'll get a little more results faster but again don't 'try' to do so

- say a phrase with high intonation (e.g. "when you draw fewer lines" from Pikat)

- play the note or hum the note of where you want to speak
- use a phrase that starts at the base pitch like "the north wind and the sun had a quarrel"
- intonation will be higher than the base pitch of course, so you'll probably go higher than the base pitch in the middle
- to start, when you intonate up and it starts coming down again, make sure it hits the base pitch
- gradually start to just speak naturally instead of control the pitch, but whenever your voice hits that base pitch, just notice that and draw attention to it
- likewise pay attention to if your voice drops below the base pitch
- you can also draw out the base pitch note longer if you need to (e.g. on "quarrel"), but prioritise just noticing it passively

- weight affects base pitch directly, so if you change weight, you will get a different base pitch
- think about sweet voices, falsetto etc. They are light, and you can just scale up toward them
- when you think about pitch in this way, it is likely that you will balance the weight correctly for the pitch you end up on
- if it's balanced it won't drop as much, and won't be strained or tense
- to test this and gain more skill:
- start at a low pitch relaxed
- go lighter, letting the voice raise in pitch if it wants to
- if it sounds like it's "the same but higher" then you probably raised pitch instead of going lighter so start again
- eventually you'll reach M2, in which case do one more lighter voice and stop
