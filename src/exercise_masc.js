`Can be used to get a heavier voice.

- start at a medium pitch
- slide down slowly to the bottom of your range
- you want to "let" the voice become heavier but not force it; this can be a sense of gaining "momentum"
- you can use breathiness to prevent going into fry, but don't rely on it too much
- that said, more air and volume does encourage weight slightly
- once you reach the bottom of your range and feel like any lower would go into fry (it's worth going all the way into fry sometimes just to get a feel for it), slide back up, getting a little bit louder as you go; this should keep the vocal weight almost as heavy as the bottom of the slide
- now you have a heavier but louder voice at a high pitch, slide down again
- repeat a few times until you don't get more progress (i.e. you can't get any lower or heavier)
- on the way up we might get louder, but on the way down we get heavier and don't need to be as loud, which means we can more effectively get heavier - without needing to shout at the low pitch

`Affects mostly mouth shape, and some larynx height.

- say "haah" like normal, or bright
- say "haww" and let it become darker (think halfway between hot and hoot, with a relaxed / slack mouth posture)
- if the larynx moves a lot this can be a problem, so focus on moving the shape of the mouth, *not* doing a yawn-like voice
- the more you keep the mouth in roughly this haww shape, the darker your overall speech will be
- experiment with the extremes, try extremely dark haww and bright haah
- apply to speech and notice the feeling of large mouth space
